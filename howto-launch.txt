Hi,

Please find two sample apps in two compressed files :
apm-imperative.zip
Sampleapp quarkus (classical imperative libs)

apm-reactive.zip
Sampleapp quarkus (reactive libs)

Unzip apm-imperative.zip
Unzip apm-reactive.zip

Launch app -> 
In apm-reactive\quarkus-app or apm-imperative\quarkus-app
java -jar quarkus-run.jar

Application is listening on port 8080.
API /v1/profileData (simple 200 OK)

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/profileData/

Please see PDF to find our screenshots / observations (open telemetry agent 1.25 -> elastic apm)

The main difference is that transaction.name and transaction.name.text are "GET /" in reactive and "GET /v1/profileData" in imperative version
url.* fields have same values

Is the transation.name set by otel agent ?

Thanks for your help.
